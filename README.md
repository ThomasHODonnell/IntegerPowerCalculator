__Integer Power Calculator__

This was my second project in CSC 1253, which was my intro to C++ course. 

_This program calculates exponential math operations with integer exponents._

This is a very basic program, that is inteneded to introduce loops, and complete basic arithmatic operations with exponents.

__How to Run?__

- Enter a valid base and exponent, and the program will output the corresponding mathimatical calculation.
